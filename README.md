# Age of Heroes Autofarm
Script:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet(("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icuck/AgeofHeroesAutofarm/master/main.lua"), true))()
```

Prototype (Use at your own risk):
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet(("https://github.com/icuck/AgeofHeroesAutofarm/raw/master/add-on.lua"), true))()
```
Prototype is often where new features are added first, but aren't fully tested, use at your own risk.
